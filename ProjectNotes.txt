The solution :

Most of the folks on Windows working with git repo’s use windows git bash for doing git check-ins and check-outs to/from from git repo…. if you are already not using it i will highly recommend use it… pretty neat tool for windows os.

Navigate to the .sh file for which permissions have to be changed to execute through gitbash
check the existing permissions by the using the following command git ls-files --stage the command will show you the current file permissions like 100644
Now git bash has command to update the file permission to execute looks like :D git update-index --chmod=+x 'name-of-shell-script'
check the file permission again git ls-files --stage ... now the file permissions will be like 100755
Now check-in the files back to github with new permissions git commit -m "made a file executable" and push the code to repo git push
